Some basic info:
  - Deadline for package is 10th of October 2024 (MICCAI)
  - POC by the end of August 2024, allow new developer commits in September or so


Dev requirements/what to keep in mind:
  - do we need any additional CLI entrypoints? should any existing ones be extended/modified?
  - for now our focus is to have one prototype of architecture working (AE, GAN and Diffusion model)
  - also, a note to keep for us regarding the architecture specific pipelines - there are GANS for style transfer, i.e. CycleGAN and they need pairs of images to work
